# Vehicle Showroom Management System in C++

Welcome to the **Vehicle Showroom Management System**, a robust C++ project implementing a variety of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, singleton, and the factory method pattern. This application allows users to manage a vehicle showroom efficiently, handling customer bookings and administrative tasks seamlessly.

## Project Features:

- **Inheritance & Polymorphism**: Utilizes inheritance for different types of vehicles and showcases polymorphism for efficient object handling and function overriding.
- **Singleton Design Pattern**: Implements the singleton pattern for certain classes, ensuring there's only one instance and providing global point of access.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Demonstrates the factory method pattern, allowing the creation of different types of vehicles while encapsulating the instantiation logic.
- **File Handling**: Implements file handling for storing and retrieving essential data, providing persistent storage for customer and vehicle details.
- **User & Admin Functionality**: Separates user and admin interfaces, allowing customers to book vehicles and administrators to manage bookings and display details.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Utilizes dynamic memory allocation for efficient storage and manipulation of data structures.

## How to Use:
1. **Customer Interface**: Users can interact with the system, view available vehicles, and make bookings.
2. **Admin Interface**: Administrators can access the system using secure credentials, manage bookings, and retrieve detailed information.
3. **File Storage**: Customer and vehicle data are stored persistently using file handling techniques, ensuring data integrity across sessions.

## Technologies Used:
- **Language**: C++
- **OOP Concepts**: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Singleton Design Pattern, Factory Method Pattern
- **Data Management**: File Handling, Dynamic Memory Allocation
